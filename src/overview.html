<body>
Contained herein is Javadoc documentation about NFC's source code.
Since there are a lot of classes and packages, here is a brief
overview:
<p>

The classes related to the client are:
<ul>
<li>com.lyrisoft.chat.client (and subpackages)
<li>com.lyrisoft.chat.server.local (and subpackages)
<li>com.lyrisoft.chat.awt    
</ul>

The classes related to the server are:
<ul>
<li>com.lyrisoft.chat.server.remote (and subpackages)
<li>com.lyrisoft.util (and subpackages)    
</ul>

Also related to the server is the "jfd" package.  This is some code
found on the web that implements the unix crypt algorithm.  It is used
in the PasswdAuthenticator, which uses a unix-style password file.

<p>
One major source of confusion are the com.lyrisoft.chat.server.<b>remote</b>
and com.lyrisoft.chat.server.<b>local</b> packages (for the server and client,
respectively).  This was an unfortunate choice of naming and
packaging, so I thought I would point it out to avoid confusion.
