	* custom room-authenticator possible (a jdbc-based one is included)
	
	* kick users from room for configureable timeout
	* kill (ban) users from server for configureable timeout
	
	* only users with accessLevel >=GOD or the operators can kill/kick other users (1.0.8: only operators)

2002-11-24 release 1.0.8, notes taken from slashdot release notes
	* Some bugs related to logging have been fixed. Logging when running as servlet now works correctly.

	* Database authentication has been enhanced. You can now restrict access to only users in the database and you can use
	 password encryption on dbms's other than MySQL. There is a document about database authentication in the doc directory.

	* Some bugs in the startup scripts have been fixed.

	* Zip files added to the release for convinience.

	* The format of the jdbcAuth file has changed slightly.

	added files for Flash client support

2000-11-1
	Version 1.0.6-rc3
	Fixed another hard-coded message left-over

	Kick was fixed (It was not properly updating the DistributedState).
	
2000-10-31
	Revisted the Netscape userlist repaint bug.  Appears to be fixed
	now. 
	
2000-10-31
	Version 1.0.6-rc2
	Added German translations (thanks to Dennis Stosberg
	dennis@stosberg.net).

	Fixed a left-over hardcoded label in ChatRoom.java.

	Improved colors in LoginPanel.

	RoomServer is now correctly taking away ops upon partting a room.
	
2000-10-30
	Version 1.0.6-rc1
	command.properties is now has extra atrributes
	"command".access - for setting the access level
	"command".help - for setting the help message
	"command".usage - for setting the usage message

        Initial implementation of "ops".  /op and /kick is implemented
	(local only; not yet distributed)

	Integrated italian translation (thanks to Aldo Armiento
	aldo@armiento.com)
	
2000-10-27
	Version 1.0.5
	Client (awt only) and server have some i18n functionality now (the
	messages/language of the software is configurable without
	recompiling).  Added English (default) and Jive :)
	messages.properties files.

	Moved getProperites() out of IChatGUIFactory, where it never
	belonged in the first place.
	
2000-10-21
	Version 1.0.4b
	Fixed the 2-Consoles bug.

2000-10-20
	Version 1.0.4a
	Windows batch files and nfc-win.conf now included as part of the
	distribution. 
	
2000-10-19
	Tidied up the environment to ensure that the clients will run in
	standalone mode.

	There is an initial (very basic) Swing implementation in here now
	as well.  
	
2000-10-18
	Version 1.0.4
	
	Fixed a major, though nearly unnoticable problem with scrolling.

	Fixed a bug where the server was pinging the client WAY too much
	(I wonder why nobody noticed before :)

	Somewhere along the line, the color params in the applet got
	broken and were not being honored.  Now fixed.

	Fixed the recently broken embedded mode (no more half-display or
	no disply problems.. hopefully)
	
2000-10-15
	Fixed minor repaint bug in ChatPanel's userlist

	Did away with the silly DefaultCommandProcessorFactory and
	DefaultUserCommandFactory.  Replaced these with dynamic
	properties-file based initialization, just like the server side.

	Added new files web/resources/userCommands.properties and
	web/resources/commandProcessors.properties which replace the old
	factories.  This will be much better for people hacking up their
	own custom version.
	
2000-10-12
	cleaned up logging quite a bit.

	mutliple provider url's for jms can be specified, and they will be
	round-robined.

	is not sent to the client unless it asks.
	
2000-10-05
	fixed null pointer exception in ChatServer that occurred if JMS
	was disabled.  

	fixed a problem with "general messages" not getting displayed in
	the embedded mode

	some minor fixes in the docs
	
2000-10-04
	VERSION 1.0.0

	NFC is now a scalable distributed system, where multiple servers
	combine to form a web of servers (conceptually similar to IRC).
	This was a big enough change in itself, so I'm calling this 1.0.0,
	even though I expect bugs.  Lots of bugs.

	There is now a protocol specification document, finally.  It is
	about 90% complete.  The code actually follows the spec very
	closely.  Any difference at this point must be resolved either in
	the code or in the spec.  (Most likely in the code)

	There is now a halfway decent install document.

	The popup dialogs (msg, ping, etc.) in the chat room are disabled
	because they weren't working on Netscape for Mac.  I spent hours
	trying to work-around it but I couldn't.  Did I mention that I
	hate applets?  I'm seriously.
	
	Completely removed the Windows .batch files.  Those have to be
	done over and done right at some point.

	Spent nearly 21 hours in front of my computer today.
	
2000-05-01
	All sorts of bugfixes.  More on the protocol.  There are still
	some messages that are sent from the server as english.  They
	need to be converted to protocol.

	Private messages now get their own little chat window.
	0.9.12
	
2000-04-28
	Changed the protocol around a bit.  It's now almost good enough :)
	
2000-04-23
	Implemented a workaround that allows the server to run on
	FreeBSD's somewhat buggy JDK1.2.2.  To enable the workaround, pass
	"-DBSD_HACK=anyvalue" to the Java runtime.  (There is a
	commented-out example in the bin/runServer script)

	Wrote a new README.
	
	Version: 0.9.10
	
2000-04-16
	Improved client timeouts.  Now, if a client crashes and the server
	doesn't notice right away, the stale connection will be cleaned up
	within 5 minutes rather than one hour.
	
2000-04-15
	Implemented a way to defeat firewalls, using a Servlet and http requests.

	Fixed the bug that was preventing the client from working in IE
	for Macintosh.
	
2000-04-??
	Started localization support on the server side.
	
2000-04-03
	Bugfixes for EmbeddedAppletGUIFactory and HyperlinkTextView.
	Version: 0.9.9.1
	
2000-04-03
	The /join command was overloaded to take an optional password.  If
	this password is passed at room creation time, the room becomes
	password-protected (which means you can only /join if you know the
	password. 

	Version: 0.9.9

2000-04-03
	Integrated the JdbcAuthenticator (contributed by Wayne A. Hogue II
	<w.hogue@chiphead.net>)
	
2000-04-03
	More menus.
	Sound. (broken in Linux/Netscape.  don't know why)
	Button bar can be disabled and reenabled.
	Server kicks off connections that have been idle for X minutes.
	
2000-04-01
	Minor com.lyrisoft.awt.HyperLinkTextView optimizations.
	Lame emote and pemote gifs. (Icons should be in the client jar, no?)
	
2000-03-30
	Fixed hardcoded file path bug. (DUH!)
	
	Cleaned up the IChatGUIFactory interface.  The methods don't take
	lots of parameters any more.

	Added a generic dialog box component
	(com.lyrisoft.chat.client.gui.awt102.Query) that displays a
	Drop-down box and/or a text input field.  It pops up when one of
	the buttons is clicked to query for data.

	The server now remembers the last X logins.

	User interface enhancements.

	Tagged version 0.9.7
	
2000-03-27
	Integrated Ignore and UnIgnore commands. (Contributed by Tasso
	Mulzer <tasso@tasso.home.cs.tu-berlin.de>)

	Tagged version 0.9.6
	
2000-03-26
	Added two applet parameters
	
	autologin: automatically logs in the specified user name (useful
	is the applet tag is generated dynamically 
	
	keepalive: if set to true, the applet will not exit when stop() is
	called (e.g., when the user goes to another page)
	
2000-03-24
	Wrote some windows batch files for building/running the client and server.
	
2000-03-23
	Wrote INSTALL_SERVER and INSTALL_CLIENT how-to's.  
	
2000-03-22
	Separate loggers for errors and messages.

	Changed Mysql object to be non-static
	
2000-03-21
	Now using image buttons.  Images by Jay Barnes (jay@ndi.net)

	Changed the default colors to match the image buttons.
	
2000-03-21: Leif Jackson
        Added the MysqlAuthentication classes, These are in beta don't use.

2000-03-20
	Changed the look of the ChatConsole.  It now has its own
	TextView.  This is where messages show up if they have nowhere
	else to go.

	The server now reads a config file, nfc.conf.

	The server now reads a "motd" file, and sends it to the clients
	upon successful login.
	
2000-03-18
	Added support for clickable hyperlinks in the ChatRoom

2000-03-18
	New Feature:  
	<param name="autojoin" value="<someroom>">

	Makes the client automatically join a particular room when the
	login completes.
	
2000-03-17
	Fixed two bugs
	1. Private messages were being confirmed wrong.
	2. The server sent back lowercase-only version of usernames for
	user lists.  This caused some weirdness on the client.

	Got rid of the useless historical information at the end of this
	file.

	Wrote the beginnings of a LoadTest tool.

	Fixed another bug
	A method of RoomServer did not have the proper synchronization.
	Under certain conditions, this was raising a
	ConcurrentModificationException (thrown from  java.util.HashMap).
	How nice indeed that the HashMap pessimistically throws this
	exception, make it far easier to debug threading issues!
	
2000-03-02
	Added a PasswdAuthenticator.  Also added a file in bin called
	nfcpasswd that lets you add a user to the passwd file.

	No attempted is made to lock the passwd file when it's been
	modified.. that's probably not good.

	Changed the classes in client.command so they throw
	NotEnoughArgumentsException up the stack.  This is caught by the
	UserCommands class and dealt with by asking the server for help on
	that command.

	Added a make dist to the Makefile.  Make dist just builds the jars
	in the lib directory.
	
2000-02-29
	The CVSROOT directory was lost.  I reimported my working copy.
	Nothing was lost, except for version history.  I guess it's no big
	deal at this point.
	
2000-02-29
	Implemented /help!

	Slightly modified the Logger so that it writes its output in a separate Thread.
	
2000-02-27
	Wrote many, many, many, many code comments.  Removed a few unused
	classes.  Moved a few classes around.  Regenerated the javadoc.
	
2000-02-24
	Cleaned up the Makefile.. Consolidated `find` stuff into a variable
	
2000-02-24
	Added Manifest skeletons src/*.MF to help the jars become executable
	with "java -jar chatclient.jar" for example.
	
2000-02-24
	Removed diff crud from Makefile. --Billy
	
200-02-24
	I sent out an email earlier today to everybody I could think of to
	come and try the code.  We found two bugs.  These have been fixed.

	BUG 1
	On some platforms (notably JDK1.0.2 and Netscape-for-Macintosh),
	there is an inconsistency with the ScrollBar.  (See
	http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4070498.html
	for description and workaround suggestion.)

	BUG 2
	I was using Graphics.translate() and Graphics.setClipRect() to
	"scroll" the textview.  This was fine on Linux and NT, but on
	Win95 and Macintosh, the clipping got all messed up for some
	reason and only a small area of the TextView was being updated.

	Solution: Not using Graphics.translate() or clipping anymore.
	Instead, each TextRun gets passed a yTranslation, and the TextRun
	draws itself bassed on that offset.  This has to work because I'm
	not clipping the graphics at all now.

	There were some other bugs in TextView that I came across and
	fixed those as well.  
	

	TODO
	- Implement a font-selector.  The only real reason for
	this is because the fonts in Netscape for Linux Java suck.

	- Send ACKs to the client when a private message is dispatched to
	the recipient.

	Mentioned below and still to do
	- KILL command
	- Simple Auth module implementation (passwd file based)

	KILL is the only command left unimplemented.  We need to implement authentication first.
	Things are in good shape.  Hardly tested at all, but everything seems to work.

	Forget DSTC TextArea.  It was king of buggy and slow.  I made my
	own.  Mine is much faster than the DSTC one, and does not include
	the bugs.  Plus, I didn't really want to pay $500.

	I am ready to implement a few final commands
	PING
	WHOIS
	STATS
	KILL

	I need to add at least one authentication plug-in (probably
	file-based).  

	I need to add buttons to the GUI to make it more user-friendly.
	Notably, buttons for all the commands above + EMOTE.  And a button
	to clear the TextView would be nice.

	Enhanced the ChatRoomPanel.. has lots of (currently inactive
	buttons).

	Made an "Are you sure" dialog for when the user clicks Sign Off
	
2000-02-20
	Now using a better TextArea component, from
	http://archive.dstc.edu.au/TU/wOrlds/phelps/text/ (I'm awaiting a
	response regarding the license)

	Created an AppletGUIFactory that keeps everything inside one
	Applet, instead of spawning multiple windows.

	Made the ChatPanel a little bit prettier.  Added some buttons to
	it (these buttons do nothing for now)
	
	Created a little RoomLister frame.  No equivalent yet for the
	applet version

	The system runs.  But it doesn't do much.

	You can log on, join a room (programattically), and talk.

	User joined and User parted notifications are sent by the server
	and processed on the client. 

	The user list in the chat room gui is consistent with the state of the
	room.

	Next steps:
	- help system
	- login dialog
	- authentication (define pluggable authentication module
	interface)
	- room "titles"
	- check applet compliance
	- change packages to com.invantix instead of com.lyrisoft
