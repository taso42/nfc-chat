This is NFC Chat version 1.x by Taso Lyristis (taso@lyrisoft.com)
http://nfcchat.sourceforge.net/

NFC is a client/server chat application written in Java.  The server
runs as a standalone application or embedded in a servlet engine.  The
latter mode enables http-tunneling, allowing users behind restrictive
firewalls or proxies to connect to your server.  The client runs as an
applet in the web browser, or a standalone application.

INSTALL.   Some Windows-specific notes are included in
INSTALL.windows.
