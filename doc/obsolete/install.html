<h1>Installing NFC</h1>
<p>
This document desribes how to obtain, build, configure, and run NFC.
It written with NFC 1.0.x in mind.  If you are using an earlier version,
it is recommended that you upgrade to the latest 1.0 version.
<p>
The instructions contained herein are written assuming that you are
working in a Unix-like environment.  If you are using something else,
such as Windows, the compilation steps described herein will not work
for you.  If you are an experienced Java developer, and you're running
Windows, you will probably be able to compile manually, using this
document and the Makefile as a guide, without too much headache.
<p>
[TODO: write an Install doc for Windows] (Any volunteers?)

<h2>1. Download</h2>
<p>
You can download the current version of NFC from SourceForge, using
the following url: <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12069&release_id=13110">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12069&release_id=13110</a>.
The file that has <code>-bin</code> in its name is the binary release.
If you download the binary then you do not have to compile (skip steps 3 and 4). 
<p>
You will also need the following:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="65%"><b>Package</b></td>
    <td><b>Download site</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Java 2 SDK</td>
    <td><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">Sun</a></td>
  </tr>	
  <tr>
    <td>Java Development Kit 1.0.2 (<i>optional</i>)</td>
    <td><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.0.2/">Sun</a></td>
  </tr>	
  <tr>
    <td>Java Servlet 2.2 API</td>
    <td><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Jakarta</a></td>
  </tr>	
  <tr>
    <td>JMS (Java Messaging Service) 1.0.2 and JNDI (Java Naming and
	Directory Service) (1.2.1) APIs</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.swiftmq.com/">SwiftMQ</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JavaDeps 1.1 (<i>optional</i>)</td>
    <td><a
	href="http://www.vet.com.au/java/javadeps/">http://www.vet.com.au/java/javadeps/</a>
  </tr>	
</table>
<hr size="1" align="left" noshade width="33%">
<small>Note: In order to compile, all that you really, really need
from Jakarta and SwiftMQ are the following three jars: servlet.jar,
jms.jar, and jndi.jar.  If you already have these on your system, or
if you have some preferences besides Jakarta and SwiftMQ, feel free to
make substitutions.  Just be sure you have the correct versions of the
API's.</small>
<p>


<a name="2"></a>
<h2>2. Unzip</h2>
<p>
Well, you should know how to do this. :)  When you unzip the package,
you will end up with a subdirectory having a name something like
nfc-1.0.0.  From now on, we'll be referring to that directory as
<code>$NFC_HOME</code>.

<a name="3"></a>
<h2>3. Edit the environment</h2>
<p>
<font color="red">[this step is not necessary if you downloaded the binary release]</font>
<p>
There is no facny configure script for NFC (I wish there was).  You have to edit a
file by hand, to bootstrap the build process.  Don't worry, this is easy.
<p>
The Makefile will look for a file called <code>.env</code>.  If that
file does not exist in <code>$NFC_HOME</code>, then you should copy the example
file, <code>env.eg</code> to <code>.env</code>
<p>
This is what that file looks like
<p>

<code>
# Example env file (to be copied or renamed to ".env").<br>
#<br>
# Please modify to suit your environment:<br>
<br>
# Home of JDK1.2.2<br>
JAVA_HOME = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2</code></em><br>
<br>
# Home of JDK1.0.2 (if you don't have this, then set it to be the same<br>
# as above <br>
JAVA_HOME_102 = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/jdk1.0.2</code></em><br>
<br>
# Location of the servlet (Java Servlet API 2.2) jar<br>
SERVLET = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/tomcat-3.1/lib/servlet.jar</code></em><br>
<br>
# Location of the JavaDeps executable (if you don't have this, don't<br>
# worry; you're probably still ok.)<br>
JDEPS = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/JavaDeps-1.1/jdeps</code></em><br>
<br>
# Location of the JMS 1.0.2 API<br>
JMS = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/swiftmq_1_1/jars/jms.jar</code></em><br>
<br>
# Location of the JNDI 1.2.1 API<br>
JNDI = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/swiftmq_1_1/jars/jndi.jar</code></em><br>
<br>
</code>

<p>
Edit the values in green to match your system.  Some notes:
<p>

<ol>
  <li>If you do not have JDK 1.0.2, don't panic.  Just set
      JAVA_HOME_102 to be the same as JAVA_HOME.
  <li>If you do not have JavaDeps, don't panic.  As long as you're
      compiling only, and not adding/changing code, the deps included
      with the distribution should work.  (Just set JDEPS to any old
      value or blank if you don't have it)
</ol>

<a name="4"></a>
<h2>4. Make</h2>
<p>
<font color="red">[this step is not necessary if you downloaded the binary release]</font>
<p>
Now that the <code>.env</code> file is correctly set up, or so we
hope, you can type <code>make</code> from the top-level NFC
directory.  After some time, if there were no errors, NFC should be
compiled and jarred.
<p>
If you notice lots of deprecation warnings during the build, it is
probably because you are not using JDK 1.0.2 to compile the client.
The client is written using the old JDK 1.0.2 API on purpose, to
ensure maximum compatability web browsers.  It is safe to ignore the
deprecation warnings.
<p>
To confirm that NFC is compiled, look in the
<code>$NFC_HOME/lib</code> directory.  You should see two jars
(chatserver.jar and chatclient.jar).  Also check the
<code>$NFC_HOME/web</code> directory and look for chatclient_awt.jar
and chatclient_swing.jar.  Those are the "web ready" jars.  If you see
all 5 jars, congratulations!  Now, on to <i>configuring</i> the
software itself.


<a name="5"></a>
<h2>5. Configure the server</h2>
<p>
The first thing you'll want to do is have a look at the
<code>nfc.conf</code> file.  Here is an example conf file
<p>

<code>
# Log files [OPTIONAL]<br>
# (If omitted, the message log goes to stdout and the error log <br>
# goes to stderr)<br>
#################################################################<br>
log.file=log/nfc.log<br>
error.log.file=log/nfc.error_log<br>
<br>
# Port to listen on [REQUIRED]<br>
listen.port=7777<br>
<br>
# Idle timeout in minutes [OPTIONAL]<br>
# If not specified (commented out), defaults to 60 minutes<br>
# If set to zero, idle timeouts are disabled<br>
idle.timeout=0<br>
<br>
# Location of the commands file [REQUIRED]<br>
commands=commands.properties<br>
<br>
# Authentication class [REQUIRED]<br>
# Specified by a fully-qualified class name. <br>
#################################################################<br>
# NullAuthenticator: authenticates everybody<br>
auth.class=com.lyrisoft.chat.server.remote.auth.NullAuthenticator<br>
<br>
# PasswdAuthenticator uses a unix-style passwd file<br>
#auth.class=com.lyrisoft.chat.server.remote.auth.PasswdAuthenticator<br>
<br>
# JMS<br>
jms.enabled=false<br>
jndi.initial=com.swiftmq.jndi.InitialContextFactoryImpl<br>
jms.provider=smqp://localhost:4001/timeout=10000<br>
jms.topic=nfc<br>
</code>

<p>
You can change any of these values to values that better suit your
taste.  Make sure that you specify exactly one
<code>auth.class</code>.  If unsure, then use the
<code>NullAuthenticator</code>.

<p>
One thing you'll probably want to do one your first time around is set
jms.enabled to false. 

<p>
After nfc.conf is squared away, you will need to have a look at the
file <code>$NFC_HOME/bin/setenv.sh</code>.  Only the first few lines
of <code>setenv.sh</code> need editting.  Similar to what you did for
the <code>.env</code> in step 3, you will need to set
<code>JAVA_HOME</code>, <code>JMS</code>, and <code>JNDI</code> to the
appropriate paths on your system.

<p>
Here is an excerpt
<p>
<code>
# Set your JDK1.2 installation<br>
JAVA_HOME = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2</code></em><br>
<br>
# Set to point to your JMS 1.0.2 jar<br>
JMS = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/swiftmq_1_1/jars/jms.jar</code></em><br>
<br>
# Set to point to a JMS IMPLEMENTATION library (if you plan to set up<br>
# or participate in a distributed chat network)<br>
JMS_IMPL = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/swiftmq_1_1/jars/swiftmq.jar</code></em><br>
<br>
# Set to the location of your JNDI 1.2.1 jar<br>
JNDI = <em class="green"><code>/usr/local/java/swiftmq_1_1/jars/jndi.jar</code></em><br>
</code>
<p>
As with the <code>.env</code> example above, edit the values in
green to match your system.  The <code>JMS_IMPL</code>
variable is something that has not appeared up until now.  This
variable is very important for running NFC in distributed mode.  If
you are setting up a standalone server, then just ignore it.  Otherwise,
set it to contain the paths(s) or jar(s) for your JMS implementation.
Multiple jars and paths can be specified by separating them with
colons.

<a name="6"></a>
<h2>6. Run the server</h2>
<p>
Assuming everything is propertly set up, simply
execute the shell-script <code>$NFC_HOME/bin/runServer</code> to start
the NFC server.
<p>
Note:  You can use the environment variable <code>JAVA_OPTS</code> to
pass arguments to the Java Virtual Machine.  Setting
<code>JAVA_OPTS</code> to "<code>-Xms10m -Xmx100m</code>" (no quotes)
will tell the JVM to allocate 10 megabytes of RAM for the initial heap
and set the maximum heap size to 100 megabytes.  For the curious, you
can set <code>JAVA_OPTS</code> to "<code>-DDEBUG=true</code>" (no
quotes) to see low-level debugging information on stderr.


<a name="7"></a>
<h2>7. Check the server</h2>
<p>
If the last line on your console after executing
<code>runServer</code> is something like this:
<p>
<code>
creating server socket.. (port 7777)
</code>
<p>
then things are looking good.

<p>
To confirm that the server is accepting connections, try telnetting
directly to the server port.  Type the command <code>/stats</code>
followed by <code>/quit</code>.
<p>
<pre>
$ telnet localhost 7777
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
/stats
Stats for research.lyrisoft.com:7777
  Number of rooms: 0
  Number of users: 0
  Uptime: 7.127 seconds

Server JVM Stats:
  Java version: 1.2.2 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
  Operating System: Linux
  Memory Usage: 199 of 1023 KB free
Other servers on this network:
  none
/quit
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>
<p>
Finally, check to see that logs are appearing where they should be
(according to what <code>nfc.conf</code> says).

<a name="8"></a>
<h2>8. Run the client</h2>
<p>
The shell script $NFC_HOME/bin/runClient will run the client.  The
client program requires 2 arguments, host and port, to be specified on
the command line.  E.g.,
<p>
<code>$ /nfc/bin/runClient localhost 7777</code>

<p>
If this worked, then the NFC login prompt will appear on your
display.  From there, you can log in and play with the program.

<p>
If you see a big stack trace, starting with something like the
following, it means that you need to set the <code>DISPLAY</code>
environment variable.  If unsure, try setting <code>DISPLAY</code> to
"<code>localhost:0</code>" (no quotes).
<p>

<pre>
Xlib: connection to "192.168.1.1:0.0" refused by server
Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.InternalError: Can't connect to
X11 window server using '192.168.1.1:0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable.
</pre>

<p>

<h2>9. Make the chat web-accessible</h2>

<p>
First and foremost, due to the applet security model, an applet may
only connect to the host from which it was downloaded.  What this
means is that there must be an HTTP server running on the same machine
that the chat server is running on.  (You can get around this by
port-forwarding).


<p>
The <code>$NFC_HOME/web</code> directory includes the applet jar files
as well as some basic HTML templates to initialize the applet.  Make
this whole directory web accessible, either by copying the whole thing
somewhere, or by explicitly putting it in your web server's config.

<p>
Here is an example applet tag that will start the NFC client in the
browser:

<p>
<code>
&lt;applet code="com.lyrisoft.chat.client.ChatClientApplet"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;archive="chatclient.jar"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width="<em class="green">400</em>"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height="<em class="green">150</em>"&gt;<br>
&lt;param name="port" value="<em class="green">7777</em>"&gt;<br>
&lt;param name="guiFactory" value="<em class="green">com.lyrisoft.chat.client.gui.awt102.AppletGUIFactory</em>"&gt;<br>
&lt;param name="bgColor" value="<em class="green">384CC7</em>"&gt;<br>
&lt;param name="userColor" value="<em class="green">0000FF</em>"&gt;<br>
&lt;param name="errorColor" value="<em class="green">FF0000</em>"&gt;<br>
&lt;/applet&gt;<br>
</code>

<p>
The values in green can be changed to match your taste or to adjust
the look.  To use an alternate GUI, you would specify the classname of
the alternate GUI "Factory".  NFC comes with one additional GUI
factory that uses one large area embedded in the browser, instead of
the typical multi-window display.  To specify the embedded GUI, use
<code>com.lyrisoft.chat.client.gui.awt102.EmbeddedAppletGUIFactory</code>
as the value for the <code>guiFactory</code> parameter.

<p>
At last, ensure that the server is still running from before, and if
not, start it up again, then visit the URL containing your brand new
chat.
