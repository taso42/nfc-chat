Installing the NFC Client
-------------------------

There are two ways to run the NFC client.  One way is as a standalone
application.  The other way is as an applet running inside of a web
browser.

In either case, you must first follow the directions in INSTALL_SERVER
to get your environment set up and get everything compiled.  

Running NFC client as a standalone application:
-----------------------------------------------

Simply execute the runClient script (in the bin directory).  runClient
requires 2 command-line arguments: host and port.  E.g.,

$ ./bin/runClient localhost 8199

That's it.  To the NFC client up as an applet, read on...

Installing/running NFC client as an applet
------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
o Any old web server :)

STEP 1:
Create a directory where you will keep the NFC client.  (e.g.,
/htdocs/nfc)

STEP 2:
Make the new directory created in STEP 1 web accessible.  

STEP 3:
Filecopymania...

  1. Copy the sample file, client.html (found in the web directory) to
     the directory you created in STEP 1.

  2. Copy the file chatclient.jar (found in lib after a successful
     compile) to the directory created in STEP 1.

  3. Copy the whole resources directory (found under adm) to the
     directory created in STEP 1.

STEP 3 (optional):
Configure the applet...

Edit the file client.html (in the directory you created in STEP 1).

Ensure that the port is set to the same port that you used when
starting up the server.

Optionally, you can supply an applet parameter that specifies 
the default chatroom to enter upon connecting.  The syntax for this
parameter is:

<param name="autojoin" value="ANY ROOM NAME">

This tag should live in between the <applet> </applet> tags.

This room will be created as soon as someone logs on for the first time.

STEP 4:
See if it worked.

Point your web browser to the web location that you set up in STEP 2.
If everything worked, you will see the NFC login screen.
