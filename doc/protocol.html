<h1>NFC Protocol Specification</h1>

<p>
This document provides an overview of the protocol used in the NFC network.

<p>
Recently NFC has changed from a monolithic server/client application to
a distributed application using the publish/subscribe paradigm.
Multiple servers collaborate to create a larger, distributed chat
network.  From a client's perspective, the network looks like one big
server.  The <a target="_parent" href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/">Java Message
Service (JMS)</a> is used to distribute messages across NFC servers.
NFC servers then use the NFC engine to distribute messages to their
clients.  There are three different entities, or nodes, in an NFC
network, and they interconnect in the following way:

<ul>
  <li><b>NFC clients</b> make a single connection to a single server
  <li><b>NFC servers</b> accept connections from multiple clients and
      optionally make a single connection to a single router and
      subscribes to a JMS <b>topic</b>.
  <li><b>JMS routers</b> accept connections from multiple servers and
      optionally make connections to other routers.
</ul>

<p>
JMS is just a general Messaging API Specification, not an
implementation.  NFC relies only on the specification, hence any JMS
1.0.2 compliant implementation can be used on the network.  Currently,
the developers use a product called SwiftMQ for the JMS
implementation.

<p>
Information and diagrams about SwiftMQ can be found on
the <a target="_parent" href="http://www.swiftmq.com/">SwiftMQ site</a>.

<p>
Information about the JMS Specification can be found on <a target="_parent" 
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/">Sun's website</a>.

<p>
When consulting JMS documentation, please note that in JMS terms, an NFC
server is a JMS client.  The NFC client is completely unaware that JMS
is being used; it relies only on the NFC protocol.

<p>
Regardless of how they are connected to each other, all the nodes in
an NFC network communicate using the NFC Protocol.


<a name="commands"></a><h2>Commands</h2>
<p>
Each node in an NFC network, whether it is a client or server,
communicates to the other nodes via commands.  The following is the
NFC 1.0 command set.
<p>
A command is a sequence strings separated by tabs and ending with a newline.

<a name="events"></a><h2>Events</h2>
<p>
On a high level, a command and it's effects can be thought of as "Events".
Below is a list of various NFC events in terms of commands that are
sent and the actions they cause.
<p>
A few notes about the format of this section.  First, the args are
omitted from the commands to avoid clutter.  Next, although in most
cases a command and it's reply are both shown, keep in mind that
repliess always occur asynchronously.  Finally, note that some commands
have the same names, but different syntax depending on context
(client-to-server, server-to-client, server-to-server).

            <li>If the user fails authentication, an error will be sent to
	  the client instead of the /signon reply.
            <li>The username that the server returns in the /signon reply
	  may not necessarily be the same username that the client
	  specified.  This would typically happen in the case that the
	  client sends a special user "id", and the server looks up
	  the appropriate screen name for that id.
            <li>A client will typically initiate <em class="event">GET_ROOM_LIST</em> and

<h3>Future directions</h3>
<p>
Let each server dynamically create a JMS queue for itself.  This will allow other
servers to send messages "directly" to that server, instead of to the
whole JMS topic.  This would come in handy for relaying messages that are
destined for specific users.

<p>

Explore the possibility of also making a queue for each room.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<a name="1"></a><a href="#1source"><li></a>A "broadcast" to all
    clients is quite different than a broadcast to all servers.
    Broadcasts to servers are sent using JMS, whereas broadcasts to
    clients are done "manually" by a server, by iterating over the list of all
    local clients.  There are exceptions to "all". For instance, if
    we're broadcasting the fact that a user named "Charlie" just
    joined a room called "FunRoom" (a /roomuser command), only the
    clients who are currently participating in "FunRoom" will be sent
    the message.
