<title>ChatBlender: The CarnageBlender mini-client</title>
</head>

<body>

<h3>Overview</h3>
ChatBlender is designed to be lightweight visually as well
as a small download.  This means that CB works well on sites
where chat must share the screen with other information,
e.g. <a href=http://www.carnageblender.com>Carnage Blender.</a>

<h3>Running ChatBlender</h3>
CB is built as chatclient_cb.jar by default.
The applet takes the following parameters:

<ul>
<li>user: required.  CB does no validation of userids, other
than to report back if the NFC server fails one.  It's up to
your web service to do any desired name validation or munging.
In particular, CB uses " " [space] as a command delimiter, so
you'll want to keep those out.
<li>password: REQUIRED.  ChatBlender does not support non-passworded accounts; sorry.
If you are really too lazy to do it right, you can always hardcode a dummy password. :P
<li>port: optional.  NFC's default is 7777 as you probably know.
<li>channel: required.  "room," in NFC-parlance.
</ul>

It's worth noting for people new to java that no host parameter
is available, because unless you jump through some VERY non-trivial
hoops to sign your applet, you're limited to connecting to
the host the applet was downloaded from, which CB figures
out for itself.

<h3>Example</h3>
See /contrib/nfc.tcl for how carnageblender.com serves up the CB applet.
