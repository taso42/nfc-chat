<h3>Overview</h3>
ajdigital wrote the first flash chat client for NFC. You can find more information on <a href="http://www.ajdigital.com/nfcchat/">www.ajdigital.com/nfcchat</a> and also in the file /web/flash/index.html which is
included with NFC. There is also a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=12069">support forum for the flash client</a> on sourceforge. 

<h3>Running the flash client</h3>
The flash client can be found in the directory /web/flash. If you are running NFC in servlet mode you can access the client 
 through http://&lt;your_server&gt;/nfc/flash/nfc.html. You may have to edit the file nfc.html to set the appropriate values
for _host and _port.
<ul>
<li>_host:  the host where NFC is running, e.g. www.your_domain.com</li>
<li>_port: the port on which NFC is running. NFC's default is 7777 as you probably know.</li>
</ul>
When editing nfc.html remeber to change the parameters in both the &lt;PARAM&gt; and &lt;EMBED&gt; tags.
