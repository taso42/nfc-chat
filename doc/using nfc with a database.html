<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>For nontrivial applications you will want to store
persistent information about your users.  NFC currently
provides interfaces to handle the following types of information:
<ul>
<li>Usernames, passwords, and global access levels
<li>Room access permissions
<li>User /ignore requests
</ul>

All of these may be managed independantly with
pluggable modules.  There are user authentication modules for
LDAP and flat files, for instance, besides databases.  All of
these have a JDBC (database) module, however, and that is what
this document is about.

<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>To use JDBC storage you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a database holding your information</li>
  <li>Get a JDBC driver for your database and edit your server startup files to 
    include the driver on the classpath.</li>
  <li>Edit the configuration file of the Jdbc modules (/contrib/jdbc.conf) and 
    copy it to the conf/ directory.</li>
  <li>Edit the NFC server configuration file to instruct the server to use the 
    Jdbc Authenticator.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="database">Setting up a database</a></h2>
<p>This document assumes that you know what a database is and how to set one up.
Popular free choices include MySQL and PostgreSQL.
<h3>User authentication</h3>
  In order for authentication in NFC to work, you need a database with a table
  that holds the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User names</li>
  <li>Passwords</li>
  <li>Access levels</li>
</ul>
<p>This module was designed with MySQL in mind.  MySQL does not
  support stored procedures, so this module assumes
  all operations take place on a simple table rather than
  allowing you to specify what statements to use for its
  operations.  Still, users of other database can get around
  this limitation with views and triggers if needed.
<p>Default values assume that the table name 
  is 'nfcusers', the user column is called 'user', the password column is called 
  'password' and the access column is called 'access'. Both the user and password 
  column must have data type char. If you are going to use password encryption, 
  the password column should be able to contain at least 32 characters. The access 
  column must be an integer. It can contain the value 0 (no access), 1 (normal 
  user), 2 (moderator) or 100 (not used at this point).

<h4>Setting a policy for guest access</h4>
<p>The options <b>auth.allowGuests</b> and <b>auth.storeGuests</b> (in nfc.conf, NOT jdbc.conf!)
  define the 
  policy for authenticating users that are not in the database. In both cases 
  the value must either be 'true' or 'false' (without the quotes) and both options 
  are optional. allowGuests defaults to true and storeGuests defaults 
  to false.<br>
  When the allowGuests option is set to true, users are authenticated regardless 
  of whether their records are found in the database. They are given access level 
  1: normal users. Users that <i>are</i> found in the database must enter the 
  correct password, or they will be denied access. You would set this option to 
  true if you have a known set of moderators (with an access level of 2) that 
  need to be authenticated and an unknown set of users that can simply be granted 
  access.<br>
  When you set the allowGuests option to false, all users not in the database 
  are denied access. You would do this restrict all access to the server to a 
  known group of users.<br>
  The storeGuests option works in conjunction with the allowGuests option. 
  If both are set to true, users are stored in the database when they first log 
  in. They are given access level 1 and their passwords are also stored. The next 
  time they log in they will only be granted access if they use the correct password. 
  You would use this policy if you want to make sure that users have the same 
  user name over sessions or, more precisely, that no two users can use the same 
  user name at different times. You can also use it as a convenient way to fill 
  the database.<br>
  If you do not want guest users stored, set storeGuests to false. Either way, 
  the storeGuests option only has effect if allowGuests is set to true.
</p>
<h4>Setting a password encryption policy</h4>
<p>With the <b>jdbc.CryptMethod</b> option you can control password encryption. 
  With password encryption, instead of storing the real passwords in the database 
  (which is generally considered a Bad Idea), you store a 'message digest' of 
  that password. A message digest is a one-way encryption; it is not possible 
  to recover the actual password from the message digest. The Jdbc Authenticator, 
  upon receiving a username and password, creates a message digest of the password 
  it receives and compares that to the message digest in the database. <br>
  The jdbc.CryptMethod option is an optional one. It defaults to the value 'none', 
  meaning no password encryption is done. The other possible values are 'md5' 
  and 'mysql' (without the quotes). If you use the md5 method, the Jdbc Authenticator 
  is responsible for creating the message digest of the passwords it receives 
  and uses the md5 algorithm (see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt">www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt</a>) 
  to do so. If you use the mysql method, the creation of the message digest is 
  left up to your MySQL database. MySQL has a built-in function to do this. Needles 
  to say, this will only work if you are actually using a MySQL database.</p>

<h3>/ignore storage</h3>
This module OTOH was designed for non-MySQL databases, in that
ignorer/ignoree tuples
are read and inserted from a table called nfc_users_ignoring_users.
If you want to change that, you'll have to use views and triggers
to pretend that's still where the action happens.

<h3>Room authentication</h3>
This is the most flexible of the modules.  There are three statements you must implement:
<ul>
<li>jdbc.isCreateAllowed: whether the specified user may create the specified room
<li>jdbc.isOpRequired: whether the server should designate an Op for the specified room if no Op is present
<li>jdbc.getRoomAccessLevel: access level of specified user for specified room.  Valid levels are as described above for system-level authentication:
	0 = no access to this room; 1 = normal user; 2 or higher = Op.
</ul>
See jdbc.conf for details and example SQL.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>contrib/mysql.sql: a MySQL script for creating the nfcusers table. Users of other databases 
      can use it as a reference.
  <li>contrib/postgresql.sql: a PostgreSQL script illustrating
      creating views for nfc that reference existing tables.
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="jdbc">The JDBC driver</a></h2>
<p>A JDBC driver is a piece of software that allows Java programs to access a 
  database. It maps the generic way in which Java talks to databases (called JDBC) 
  to the specific implementation of a particular database. There is a different 
  driver for every DBMS (DataBase Management System).</p>
<p>You will need to find a database driver for your DBMS, as NFC distributions 
  do not include any. Then you will need to put your driver file somewhere on 
  your hard drive (in the 'lib' directory of your NFC distribution, for example) 
  and edit your server startup scripts so that NFC will find the driver file.</p>
<p>If you use Windows, your startup script is runServer.bat or runFlashServer.bat. 
  In the section where the variables are declared, add the following lines:</p>
<code>REM Set the full path to the JDBC driver jar.<br>
      SET JDBC_JAR=[driver file]
</code>
<p>Where [driver file] is the full path to the driver file (that is, the directory 
  in which your driver file is located and the name of the file). Then change 
  the line that reads:</p>
<code>SET CLASSPATH=%NFC_HOME%;%NFC_HOME%\conf;%NFC_HOME%\lib\chatserver.jar;%JMS_JAR%;%JNDI_jar%;%JMS_IMPL%</code><br>
to:<br>
<code>SET CLASSPATH=%NFC_HOME%;%NFC_HOME%\conf;%NFC_HOME%\lib\chatserver.jar;%JMS_JAR%;%JNDI_jar%;%JMS_IMPL%;%JDBC_JAR%</code>
<p>If you use Linux, edit the setenv.sh file. Include the line:</p>
<code>JDBC=[driver file]</code>
<p>Where [driver file] is the full name of the driver file, and then change the 
  line that reads:</p>
<code>CLASSPATH=$NFC_HOME/lib/chatserver.jar:$NFC_HOME/lib/chatserver_flash.jar:$NFC_HOME/lib/chatclient_full.jar:$NFC_HOME:$JMS:$JNDI</code><br>
to<br>
<code>CLASSPATH=$NFC_HOME/lib/chatserver.jar:$NFC_HOME/lib/chatserver_flash.jar:$NFC_HOME/lib/chatclient_full.jar:$NFC_HOME:$JMS:$JNDI:$JDBC</code><br>
<p>Make sure that JDBC=... comes before CLASSPATH=....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="authenticator">Configuring the Jdbc Authenticator</a></h2>
<p>When the Jdbc Authenticator is initialized, it reads it configuration from a 
  file named 'jdbc.conf'. This section explains the configuration options 
  set in that file. The Jdbc Authenticator looks for jdbc.conf in the 'conf' 
  directory of NFC_HOME (the root directory of your NFC distribution), but by 
  default the file is located in the 'contrib' directory. You'll need to copy 
  it to the proper directory.<br>
  Note that both option names and option values are case-sensitive. All options 
  are mandatory unless stated otherwise.</p>
<h3>Setting the driver class name and the database URL</h3>
<p>The first two options in the configuration file are <b>jdbc.Class</b> and <b>jdbc.DBUrl</b>. 
  They specify the JDBC driver class name and the location of the database, respectively.<br>
  Note that jdbc.Class is not the the driver file used in the previous section, 
  but a class file contained therein. See the documentation of your JDBC driver 
  for the name of the driver class file.<br>
  JDBC drivers use a URL to locate a database. The format of the URL varies from 
  driver to driver, so consult the driver documentation. Some JDBC drivers include 
  the database username and password in the URL. If your driver does, include 
  them and leave the jdbc.DBUsername and jdbc.DBPassword options blank.</p>
<h3>Setting the database user name and password</h3>
<p>The options <b>jdbc.DBUsername</b> and <b>jdbc.DBPassword</b> set -as one would 
  expect- the username and password needed to access the database. Set them accordingly. 
  The user needs no other privileges then to add, modify and remove records from 
  the table that holds the user names, passwords and access levels.</p>
  
<h2><a name="nfc">Configuring NFC to use your database</a></h2>
<p>The final step in using the database is to instruct the NFC server 
  to use the appropriate JDBC modules. Set the appropriate
  properties in nfc.conf to do this.  The lines are already there;
  all you have to do is comment out the Null line and uncomment the Jdbc line.
<ul>
<li>User authentication: auth.class
<li>Ignore storage: ignoreStore.class
<li>Room authentication: roomAuth.class
</ul>
</p>
For example, for user authentication you would comment out the line
<p><code>auth.class=com.lyrisoft.chat.server.remote.persistence.auth.NullAuthenticator</code></p>
<p>by prepending it with a #. Then uncomment the line:</p>
<p><code>auth.class=com.lyrisoft.chat.server.remote.persistence.auth.JdbcAuthenticator</code></p>
<p>by deleting the # that precedes it.</p>
